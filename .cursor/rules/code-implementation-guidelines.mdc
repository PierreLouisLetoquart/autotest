## Code Implementation Guidelines

Follow these rules when you write code:
- **Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.**
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use functions instead of consts, for example, “function toggleStuff() {}”. Also, define a type if possible.
- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- **Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task**
- **Write thorough tests for all major functionality**
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
